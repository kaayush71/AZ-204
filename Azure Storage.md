## Encryption
1. Microsoft managed key / Customer managed key.

## SAS Token
1. We can generate sas (shared access signature) to provide access to a specific file inside blob storage or complete container using SAS token.
2. In this we have a large variety of customization like we can give only read/write acess or we can access to a specifi IP or for a particular time frame etc.
3. Sas tokens are valid till the acess key that we have used to sign that sas token is valid.

## AZ-Copy
1. AzCopy is a command-line utility that you can use to copy blobs or files to or from a storage account. 
2. It can be used to copy a file from one container into another.
3. We can use SAS token or Azure-AD(active directory) to copy file from one container to another.
